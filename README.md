Project Crateless – Mission Statement

Project Crateless aims to spotlight shelter animals based on the length of time they’ve been waiting for a home.
While most shelters highlight newly admitted pets, we focus on those who have been in the system the longest — the ones most often overlooked. Our mission is to help these animals find loving, permanent homes faster.

We utilize the PetFinder RESTful API to access real-time data on adoptable pets and surface those with the greatest need.

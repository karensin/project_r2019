Project Crateless 

Mission 

Project Crateless is created to shine a light on animals based on the time they have spent in the shelter.
While most shelter display the most recent pets admitted to the shelter, our goal is to focus on featuring the animals that have been admitted to the shelter the longest. Our mission is to focus on getting shelter animals a forever home sooner.

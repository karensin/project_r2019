                    <p>
                        <strong>Project Crateless</strong> was created to shine a light on shelter animals
                        that have been waiting the longest for a home. While many platforms prioritize newly
                        admitted pets, we believe the spotlight should be on the animals who have been overlooked.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our mission is to help these long-term residents find their forever homes faster by
                        bringing visibility to their stories. Every animal deserves a chance at love ‚Äî and we‚Äôre
                        here to make sure none are left behind.
